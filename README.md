## About Me 
I am a software developer from Vancouver BC, Canada, where I live with my wife and daughter. 
I like going down to kits beach and pacific spirit forest park with my family and friends, which are right in my neighborhood.
I also work as a professional bassist with the Vancouver Symphony on the weekends. 

## ‚òïÔ∏è What motivates me
- Mission-Driven Excellence: The belief that my work can create positive and meaningful impact drives me to contribute to projects that align with a greater purpose.
- Continuous Growth: The opportunity to develop new skills and enhance existing ones fuels my enthusiasm to learn and adapt in the ever-evolving field of software development.
- Innovation and Challenges: The prospect of solving unique and complex challenges excites me, pushing me to think creatively and develop innovative solutions.
- Client-Centric Approach: Knowing that my work directly impacts clients and end-users motivates me to create tailored and impactful software solutions that meet their needs.

## One-on-ones 
I really like getting to know someone and finding common ground. 
I enjoy collaboration, even more so when both parties show up prepared. 

## üôè Who I work best with
I think politeness is important and this encompasses many aspects of working together:
- being mindful of others' time and effort by coming prepared 
- willing to listen and learn the situation before speaking
- able to adjust and realign when challenged and criticized
- There is always a constructive way to say something. Butting heads waste time and energy 

## Technical Preferences 
I think it is important to build/show something first and then make it better; it is hard to make meaningful progress when everything is based on ideas.
Therefore I prefer technologies that enable a lot of action.
