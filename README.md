## About Me 
I am a software developer from Vancouver BC, Canada, where I live with my wife and daughter. 
I like going down to Kits beach and Pacific Spirit Forest Park with my family and friends, which are right in my neighborhood.
I also work as a professional bassist with the Vancouver Symphony on the weekends. 

## ‚òïÔ∏è What motivates me
- Projects aligned with a greater purpose where my work can create positive and meaningful impact.
- The opportunity to develop new skills and enhance existing ones so that I can learn and adapt in the ever-evolving field of software development.
- Solving unique and complex challenges that push me to think creatively and develop innovative solutions.
- Knowing that my work directly impacts clients and end-users.
  
##  One-on-ones 
I really like getting to know someone and finding common ground through 1-1 meetings. I enjoy collaboration, even more so when both parties show up prepared.

## üôè Who I work best with
Politeness is important for a successful workplace. To me, this looks like:
- Being mindful of others' time and effort by coming prepared.
- Having a willingness to listen and learn about a situation before speaking.
- Adjusting and realigning perspectives when challenged and criticized.
- Using a constructive tone when offering feedback. Butting heads wastes time and energy.

## üíª Technical Preferences 
I think it is important to build/show something first and then make it better; it is hard to make meaningful progress when everything is based on an intangible idea. I prefer technologies that enable a lot of action.
