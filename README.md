## About Me 
I am a software developer from Vancouver BC, Canada, where I live with my wife and daughter. 
I like going down to kits beach and pacific spirit forest park with my family and friends, which are right in my neighborhood.
I also work as a professional bassist with the Vancouver Symphony on the weekends. 
## I believe in 
- Being prepared 
- Being honest with yourself about how much work you've done 
- Always have the humility to learn from any situation
- Not giving up 

## One-on-ones 
I really like getting to know someone and finding common ground. 
I enjoy collaboration, even more so when both parties show up prepared. 

## Teamwork Preferences 
I think politeness is important and this encompasses many aspects of working together:
- being mindful of others' time and effort by coming prepared 
- willing to listen and learn the situation before speaking
- able to adjust and realign when challenged and criticized
- There is always a constructive way to say something. Butting heads waste time and energy 

## Technical Preferences 
I think it is important to build/show something first and then make it better; it is hard to make meaningful progress when everything is based on ideas.
Therefore I prefer technologies that enable a lot of action.

## Feedback 
I appreciate feedback very much; it gives me a chance to look at myself in a new light and make myself better.
