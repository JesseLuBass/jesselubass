### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## What is this?
This document is a HUG - a Human User Guide! It tells you a little about myself, how to work with me, and what my likes and dislikes are.

## About Me 
I live in Vancouver, BC. I am an expectant father with my first child arriving in January next year. I used to be a professional double bassist and still play a lot. 
I started my CS journey two years ago and have enjoyed every step of the process since then. I can be very outgoing and communicative due to my arts background, but I really appreciate my alone time. 

## I believe in 
- Being prepared 
- Being honest with yourself about how much work you've done 
- Always have the humility to learn from any situation
- Not giving up 

## One-on-ones 
I really like getting to know someone and finding common grounds. 
I enjoy collaboration, even more so when both parties show up prepared. 

## Teamwork Preferences 
I think politeness is important and this encompasses many aspects of working together:
- being mindful of others' time and effort by coming prepared 
- willing to listen and learn the situation before speaking
- able to adjust and realign when challenged and criticized
- There is always a constructive way to say something. Butting heads waste time and energy 

## Technical Preferences 
I think it is important to build/show something first and then make it better; it is hard to make meaningful progress when everything are based on ideas.
Therefore I prefer technologies that enable a lot of action.

## Feedback 
I appreciate feedback very much; it gives me a chance to look at myself in a new light and make myself better.
